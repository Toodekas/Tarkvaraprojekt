#### Setting up developer workflow for frontend/[gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/)

0. Make sure you have the current stable [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed. 
    * check if git works
        * `git --version` should output something similar to `"git version 2.9.3.windows.2"`
    * check if yarn works
        * `yarn --version` > `"1.9.4"`
    * check if node works
        * `node --version` > `"v9.6.1"`
 
1. Install global dev packages
    * Gatsby: `yarn global add gatsby-cli`
    * Any others that throw an error when running one of the later commands

2. Clone this repo and go into the frontend folder
    * `git clone https://github.com/TornOne/Tarkvaraprojekt`
    * `cd Tarkvaraprojekt`
    * `cd frontend`

3. Install all local project dependencies
    * `yarn install`

4. Start development server with hotloading
    * `yarn develop`
    * check if it's working by visiting `localhost:8000` in your browser. If there's another service running on port `8000` already, gatsby will use the next port, which can be seen from the output of `yarn develop`. 

#### Building the frontend
1. Do steps 0-3 in setting up the development environment
2. `yarn build` will build the production version of the site, outputting all the static files to `./public`
3. [optional] To test the production version of the site, an easy way is to run `yarn serve`, which will create a server from those files.
